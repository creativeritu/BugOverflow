# BugOverflow
BugOverflow aims to share and learn through various bugs encountered by everyone of us during assignment/project development. Additionally, one can also share solutions used to resolve the bugs or seek help from others. This application would not only help promote peer-learning but would also help novice learners to learn from the experiences of their seniors or even peers.

### Learning Outcomes: 
Students will be able to create a complete web-based (client-server) application involving front-end and back-end development, interfacing with a database.

## Objective: Creating the BugOverflow 
The BugOverflow will allow a student to upload a bug that he/she encounters during an assignment/project development. The student may upload the bug either to seek a solution to a problem being faced or may also choose to share a solution of the same, at the same time or later. Peers/seniors/friends can access the site and help provide solutions or enhanced suggestions to the bugs.

### Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, SQL Lite DB, GitHub

## Task (Steps to be performed):

 - Design a user-friendly user interface* for your bug application.
 - Provide feature for authenticated student login.
 - Each student should be able to view a list of the bugs already posted on the site. Student should be able to select a bug and view additional details about the same.
 - Student should also be able to create a bug post and upload solutions to his/her own bug post or for the bug posts uploaded by other users. <br>
 *Bonus: You can choose to create a detailed dashboard if you wish. This will fetch you extra marks.

## Expected Deliverables:
 - The students are expected to create a GitHub repo for their project and share a link to the same.
 - Additionally, a presentation containing the following is also required:  <br>
	-- Draw a use-case diagram of your application, identifying all the actors and the important use cases. <br>
	-- A snapshot of the UI/dashboard of the home page of the site. <br>
        -- A snapshot of the UI for uploading a bug/adding solution to a bug. <br>
        -- Details about additional features that have been incorporated, if any. <br>
